    "> The paper and the software address an issue that has plagued the quantum Monte Carlo community for years and the authors have applied theory that exploits the analytic structure of the Matsubara Green'S function to improve the state of affairs.\n",
    "> All the work and the obtained experiences have been made available to the public in a software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a very valuable contribution to the scipost codebases journal and I recommend publication after a few minor improvements to the paper."

    "> The authors have invested quite some time into the numerical stability of their algorithm, yet the determination of the optimal number of Matsubara frequancies to include for the construction of the Pick matrix works on the assumption that utilizing the cholesky decomposition for determining positive deficniteness \"just works\", although it is hard problem (S.M. RUMP, VERIFICATION OF POSITIVE DEFINITENESS, 2006)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our response:**\n",
    "Thank you for the very informative indication. As you pointed, numerical Cholesky deconposition does not give the criterion of positivity definiteness of a matrices. However, in our code, multiple precision arithmetic is adopted in Cholesky deconposition. Therefore, rounding error could be irrelevant for the result. We have addressed this issue in Section 2.2.3 and Section 4 where a detailed discussion has been added. "
